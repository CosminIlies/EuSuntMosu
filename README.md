## About
  This is a website made for a contest. It is a web application made React and Tailwind and for the backend I used Python. The application tries to solve the problem of loneliness before Christmas by exchanging gifts with a stranger. I am very proud because I took the 1st prize.
I used React for the Front-end and Python with Flask for the Back-end

## Technologies used
  - React (Javascript)
  - Tailwind
  - Flask (Python)
  - MySQL
